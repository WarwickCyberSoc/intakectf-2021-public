This challenge takes a PNG image with 0x0 dimensions, and the task is to identify what's wrong and fix it.

A quick look at the header file will reveal that the image actually has 0x0 dimensions, so it'll never open
if the dimensions aren't correct. 

So, the idea here is to brute force the dimensions of the image. I've provided a Python solve script,
which will check the image CRC in order to determine if the correct dimensions have been found.
